# ModularArithmetic 

A simple type safe implementation of modular arithmetic as used in number theory. 
It's very similar to the [modular-arithmetic](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/modular-arithmetic) package from [Tikhon Jelvis](https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/modular-arithmetic). 

The reason to write my own version was just to get some exprience with simple type level programming. 
For productive work you should use the version of Tikhon!
